A Gemini Protocol browser for Android. There won't be any more work done on this by the original author but it's being made available under the [Anti-Capitalist License](https://anticapitalist.software/) for anyone else to update/fix if they like. The code was last touched in 2021 so the usual Gradle and dependency updates will be required.

Fork instead of submitting PRs.
